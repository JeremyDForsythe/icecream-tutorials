	ECOSTRESS primarily measures land surface temperatures (LST), so let's look at the thermometer at one of the hottest places on the planet: Death Valley, California. The highest recorded ground temperature was verified at 201 degrees F on July 15, 1972. However, it recently had one of the hottest months on record, where air temperatures reached upwards of 128 degrees F in July of 2023. We are going to download the land surface temperature data from ECOSTRESS for those days to see how close it was to breaking the ground surface temperature record.
	
	\kulbox{\textbf{NOTE:} ECOSTRESS launched on July 9, 2018, so as you think about potential projects, you cannot design a project that requires data before that date.}

\end{minipage}}

\section{Basemaps \& Plugins}

In tutorial 2, we added in a simple basemap through a service included in the base QGIS installation. Today, we are going to expand QGIS's functionality by using an available plugin: HCMGIS. \href{https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/training_manual/qgis_plugins/fetching_plugins.html}{Plugins} are external pieces of software that add useful features to QGIS. 

\centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{QGIS_Plugins.png}}

1. Open QGIS and start a new project by selecting the \textit{Project} menu $\rightarrow$ then \textit{New}. To install the HCMGIS plugin, click on the \textit{Plugins} drop down menu and select \textit{Manage and Install Plugins}.

2. In the next window, make sure \textit{All} is selected in the first window pane and search for HCMGIS. HCMGIS is plugin that allows for easy imports of a wide selection of basemaps.

3. Click \textit{Install Plugin} and wait for the installation to complete.

\vspace{1em}

4. To quickly and easily add a basemap, all you need to do is find the \textit{HCMGIS} menu bar, select \textit{Basemap}, then pick your preferred map. For today's map, we will use \textit{Google Satellite}, though you could play around with other options. Some other favorites are ``ESRI Imagery'',``ESRI Delorme'', ``Stamen Terrain'', and ``NASA Black Marble'', though their utility depends on the goal(s) of your map. Note that clicking on a basemap type automatically adds a new layer to your map, as seen in the layer browser window.

\section{Importing Our ECOSTRESS Death Valley Layer}

\vspace{1em}

\centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ImportLST.png}}

\vspace{1em}

5. Use the \textit{browser} window to find the folder where you saved the two Death Valley land surface temperature .tif files from tutorial 3. Double click each file to add them to your map. Notice they are now also listed in the \textit{Layers} window.

6. Congrats! You now have ECOSTRESS data on a map. But wait...let's make it look just a little better before you celebrate your win. QGIS doesn't know what kind of data this is and has defaulted to displaying the information in grayscale, which isn't that useful to our eyes. For each land surface temperature layer, right click on the layer name in the \textit{Layers} window and select \textit{Layer Properties}. On the menu bar to the left, select \textit{Symbology} and change the \textit{Render type} to Singleband pseudocolor. Since this is temperature, it is common to use a red color ramp. QGIS has automatically determined the minimum and maximum values from the datafiles; however, we have two files, so we need to make them match. Specify 306.82 as the minimum and 347 as the maximum for both layers. Click \textit{apply}.

7. Lastly, add in the border from the DeathValleyNationalPark.zip shapefile. In the \textit{Browser} window expand the zip file using the small arrow next to the filename. Double click on \textit{Death Valley National Park.shp} to add the layer. Right click on the layer in the \textit{Layers} window and change the symbology to \textit{outline blue}.

8. Now we can celebrate... Your map should resemble the one below:

\vspace{1em}

\kulbox{\textbf{NOTE:} There was not full data coverage for the entire park available, that is why the Northernmost part of the park does not have any color overlayed. This happens sometimes due to the orbit of the satellite.}

\newpage

9. Save your QGIS Project into the folder with all of the other files from this tutorial by going to the \textit{Project} menu bar at the top and selecting \textit{Save As...}. Maintain the file format as .QGZ.

10. Finally, export your map. From the \textit{Project} menu, navigate to \textit{Import/Export} and select \textit{Export Map To Image}. Increase the resolution to 200 dots per inch (DPI). You will submit this map, so save it into the same folder.

High Five! You have learned how to download ECOSTRESS instrument data from A$\rho\rho$EEARS and make a basic map in QGIS.
