<h2>Getting To Know QGIS</h2>
<p>While you wait for AρρEEARS to crunch the numbers and retrieve your data from the depths of its database, let’s get you an introduction to QGIS, the software you downloaded in the previous tutorial.</p>
<p>On Windows, open QGIS Desktop from the start menu or desktop icon.</p>
<p>On Mac, open QGIS by selecting it in Launchpad or use Go → Applications and double click on QGIS.</p>
<p>Your screen will likely resemble something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Browser Panel &amp; Layers List</strong>
<ul>
<li>The browser panel lets you easily navigate files and databases. We will use it to import map layers and satellite data.</li>
<li>In the layers list, you will see all the map layers we have imported for the given project we are working on. Layer examples include a base map (like google maps), satellite raster data (pixels each with a given value… like temperature), and vector data (points, lines, shapes… like roads).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Toolbars</strong>
<ul>
<li>Our most often used sets of tools can be found in the toolbars. For example, the <em>Project</em> toolbar allows you to save, load, print, and start a new project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Main Work Area / Map canvas</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is where the map itself is displayed. In the map canvas you can interact with the visible layers: zoom in/out, move the map, select features and many other operations that we will dive into in the next weeks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Status bar</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shows you information about the current map. Also allows you to adjust the map scale, the map rotation and see the mouse cursor’s coordinates on the map.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Locator bar</strong>
<ul>
<li>Within this bar you can quickly access to almost all the objects and functions of QGIS: layers, layer features, algorithms, spatial bookmarks, etc, by typing in what you are looking for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Try It Out! Explore Your First Map…</h2>
<h3>I. Add a Basemap Layer</h3>
<img src="QGISbasemap.png" alt="Adding A Basemap" width = 1000> 
<ol>
<li>In the browser window expand your options by clicking on the small arrow next to <em>XYZ Tiles</em>.</li>
<li>Double click on Open Street Map to load in a basic open source map. You will notice that we just added a layer to the layer window below.</li>
<li>You can zoom in and out with the magnifying glass icons in the toolbar. The little hand is the pan map function which allows you to move the map around when you are zoomed in. Maybe try finding your home or a favorite place in the world? To reset to the default view you can use the zoom full function (magnifying glass with the arrows in all directions).</li>
</ol>
<h3>II. Add in an Interesting Layer Via Shapefiles</h3>
<p>Shapefiles are a common geospatial file type that stores locations, points, lines, and shapes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download this zipped folder from our website to your local computer. Make sure you save it somewhere you can remember.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jeremydforsythe.github.io/icecream-tutorials/Tutorial_GettingToKnowQGIS/Time_Zones.zip" target="_blank"> US Timezones</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<img src="TimeZones.png" alt="Adding Time Zones" width = 1000>
<ol start="2">
<li>After you have the file, use the browser window to locate <em>Time_Zones.zip</em> in the folder you saved it to. Use the little arrow to expand the zip file and double click on the <em>Time_Zones.shp</em> shapefile. Just as before we have now added a new layer to our map.</li>
</ol>
<img src="TimeZoneSymbol.png" alt="Changing Time Zone Visuals" width = 1000>
<ol start="3">
<li>This looks a little clunky, so let’s make it more readable and useful. Right click on Windows/Linux or control click on Mac to open up the properties window. Navigate to the symbology window and select green outline. Click <em>Apply</em> and <em>OK</em>.  Then zoom and pan the map to center on North America, given that these are only US Timezones.</li>
</ol>
<img src="TimeZoneLabels.png" alt="Adding Time Zone Labels" width = 1000>
<ol start="4">
<li>Next let’s add labels. Open the Time Zone properties back up and navigate to the <em>Labels</em> window. From the drop down menu at the top select <em>Single Labels</em>. Play around with the options to get the colors how you like them or maybe use one of the included styles, like <em>water bodies</em>. Click <em>Apply</em> and <em>OK</em>.</li>
</ol>
<img src="Export.png" alt="Adding Time Zone Labels" width = 1000>
<ol start="5">
<li>Lastly, we want to save your map so you can marvel at your work anytime you’d like and share it with friends at parties. From the <em>Project</em> menu navigate to <em>Import/Export</em> and select <em>Export Map To Image</em>. By default it will use the extent that you have in the viewer. I recommend upping the resolution to 200 dpi. You will submit this map later, so save it somewhere you can remember. High-five! You have made a map.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Bonus</h3>
<p>If you still have time and are so inclined you can check out these other interesting shapefiles from the Orange County GIS Database:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jeremydforsythe.github.io/icecream-tutorials/Tutorial_GettingToKnowQGIS/Regional_Subbasins_and_Watersheds.zip" target="_blank"> Watersheds of Orange County</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jeremydforsythe.github.io/icecream-tutorials/Tutorial_GettingToKnowQGIS/OC_Parks_Trails.zip" target="_blank"> Hiking Trails of Orange County</a></li>
</ul>
